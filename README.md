## Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms generate large volumes of transactional and behavioral data, yet identifying high-value customers early in their lifecycle remains a significant challenge.

While a small percentage of customers typically contribute a majority of revenue, this information is only known after an extended purchase history. Traditional rule-based systems fail to capture complex customer behavior patterns and cannot reliably predict future customer value.

This project aims to build an end-to-end AI-powered analytics platform that enables early identification of high-value customers using scalable data engineering and machine learning capabilities provided by Databricks Lakehouse.
